# MatrixMe
Combination Processing sketch and Arduino app to display Kinect user outline on 16x16 RGB LED matrix

**NOTE 11/30/2016:** This code was written using Processing 2 and SimpleOpenNI 0.27, and later versions of the library (v1.96) and Processing (v3) cause this to not work. If you want to use this, I'd suggest reverting to Processing 2 and SimpleOpenNI 0.27. Should the library get updated to work in Processing 3, or another method found, I'll update this note and the code.
